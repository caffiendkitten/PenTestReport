# 0.0 Assessment Information

## 0.6 Finding Severity Ratings

The following table defines levels of severity and corresponding CVSS score range that are used throughout the document to assess vulnerability and risk impact.



| Severity      | CVSS V3 Score Range | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical      | 9.0-10.0            |  Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level compromise.  It is advised to form a plan of action and patch immediately.                                                   |
| High          | 7.0-8.9             | Exploitation is more difficult but could cause elevated privileges and potentially a loss of data or downtime.  It is advised to form a plan of action and patch as soon as possible.             |
| Moderate      | 4.0-6.9             | Vulnerabilities exist but are not exploitable or require extra steps such as social engineering.  It is advised to form a plan of action and patch after high-priority issues have been resolved. |
| Low           | 0.1-3.9             | Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organization’s attack surface.  It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window.                      |
| Informational | N/A                 | No vulnerability exists.  Additional information is provided regarding items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation.                                               |
