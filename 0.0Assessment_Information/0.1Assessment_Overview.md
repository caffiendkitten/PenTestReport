# 0.0 Assessment Information

## 0.1 Assessment Overview

DC Security is at the forefront of application security and penetration testing and specializes in web application penetration techniques and practices, identifying areas for improvement. 
Our consultants use the results of the automated scan, paired with their expert knowledge and experience, to finally conduct a manual security analysis  that go beyond basic automated tests to identify real attack vectors that can be used against the client’s applications.
Our assessors attempt to exploit and gain remote unauthorized access to data and systems. The detailed results of both the vulnerability scan and the manual testing are shown in this report.

__Service Description__
From May 20th, 2020 to May 29th, 2019, SEPA engaged DC to evaluate the security posture of its infrastructure compared to current industry best practices that included an external penetration test. 
All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Top 10, and customized testing frameworks. 


__Vulnerability Identification__
Phases of penetration testing activities include the following:
•	Planning – Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained.
•	Discovery – Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
•	Attack – Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
•	Reporting – Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses.
