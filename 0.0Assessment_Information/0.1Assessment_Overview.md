# 0.0 Assessment Information

## 0.1 Assessment Overview

DC Security is at the forefront of application security and penetration testing and specializes in web application penetration techniques and practices, identifying areas for improvement. 
Our consultants use the results of the automated scan, paired with their expert knowledge and experience, to finally conduct a manual security analysis  that go beyond basic automated tests to identify real attack vectors that can be used against the client’s applications.
Our assessors attempt to exploit and gain remote unauthorized access to data and systems. The detailed results of both the vulnerability scan and the manual testing are shown in this report.

#### Service Description
Starting May 20th, 2020, Secure etc/Passwd App (SEPA) engaged DC Security (DC) to evaluate the security posture of its infrastructure compared to current industry best practices that included an external penetration test. 
All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115<sup>#7</sup> Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Top 10, and customized testing frameworks. 


#### Phases of penetration testing activities include the following:
- Assessment Information: Pre-engagement planning where the customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained.
- Executive Summary: A short document that is produced for business purposes and summarizes the longer report in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with the large body of material without having to read it all. 
- Attack Narrative: Full details how multiple weaknesses were leveraged to gain full compromise of the application.
  - Reconnaissance/Intelligence Gathering: Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
  - Threat Modeling: Provides clarity as far as the organization’s risk appetite and prioritization.
  - Exploitation/Attack: Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
  - Summery of Findings: Document all found vulnerabilities, exploits, and failed attempts.
- Conclusion: Document all company strengths and weaknesses.
  - Remediation: Documentation of recommended actions.
