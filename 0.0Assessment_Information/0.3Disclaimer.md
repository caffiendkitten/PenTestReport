# 0.0 Assessment Information

## 0.3 Disclaimer

A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. Therefor, the findings and recommendations this document provide are as is, without warranty, and reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.

Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls and it is possible that new vulnerabilities may have been discovered since the tests were run. DC prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. For this reason, this report should be considered a guide, not a 100% representation of the risk threatening your systems, networks and applications and DC recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.
