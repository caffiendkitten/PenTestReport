# PenTest Report for my Flatiron School final project.
During my time at Flatiron School I created a password manager for my final project, which can be found [here](https://flatiron-passwordmanager.netlify.app/). Though a seemingly simple task, this threw me for a fun loop into authentication and cryptography; and now it is time to test it.<br />

This will be a full evaluation of the security posture of the application I built compared to 
    current industry best practices, such as THE PTES, OWASP top 10, and NIST. This will include both 
    manual and automated testing as well as an evaluation of the vulnerabilities found and their suggested remediation.<br />

Front End Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/caffiendkitten/Final-Project-Frontend).<br />
Back End Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/caffiendkitten/Final-Project-Backend).

## ** Disclaimer **
This project is meant to be educational to the process and should not be considered a real report.<br />
The report will be between to fictional companies; etc/Passwd App (SEPA) and DC Security (DC).<br />
See the [References][100] for the sample reports that I used as a base template for this project.<br />
And please don't steal their hard work.
