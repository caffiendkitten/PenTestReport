# 1.0 Attack Narrative

## 1.4 Research And Exploitation

This section is the largest phase where everything is evaluated. It will involve taking all potential vulnerabilities identified in the previous Information Gathering phase of the assessment and attempting to exploit them as an attacker would though automatic scanning, as well as manual identification, and exploitation of any issues that might require further analysis and to help prevent any false positives.

This phase helps to evaluate the realistic risk level associated with the successful exploitation of the vulnerability, analyze the possibility of exploit/attack chains, and account for any mitigating controls that may be in place. 

This phase will include business logic flaws, authentication/authorization bypasses, direct object references, parameter tampering, and session management.

Tools may include: Burp Suite, ZAP, Browser Developer Tools, sqlmap,
