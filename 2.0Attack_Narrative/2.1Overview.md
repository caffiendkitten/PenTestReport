# 2.0 Attack Narrative

## 2.1 Overview


This “Attack Narrative” section details how multiple weaknesses were leveraged to gain full compromise of the application.
For the purposes of this black box assessment, Secure etc/Passwd Application (SEPA) provided minimal information outside of the organizational domain name: https://flatiron-passwordmanager.netlify.app. The intent was to closely simulate an adversary without any internal information. 

To avoid targeting systems that were not owned by SEPA, all identified assets were submitted for ownership verification before any attacks were conducted. 


#### Phases of the Attack Narrative activities will include the following:
- Reconnaissance/Intelligence Gathering: Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
- Threat Modeling: Provides clarity as far as the organization’s risk appetite and prioritization.
- Exploitation/Attack: Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
- Reporting: Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses.
