# 2.0 Attack Narrative

## 2.1 Overview


This “Attack Narrative” section details how multiple weaknesses were leveraged to gain full compromise of the application.
For the purposes of this black box assessment, Secure etc/Passwd Application (SEPA) provided minimal information outside of the organizational domain name: https://flatiron-passwordmanager.netlify.app. The intent was to closely simulate an adversary without any internal information. 

To avoid targeting systems that were not owned by SEPA, all identified assets were submitted for ownership verification before any attacks were conducted.
