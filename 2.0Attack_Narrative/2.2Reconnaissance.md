# 2.0 Attack Narrative

## 2.2 Reconnaissance


#### Passive Reconnaissance
Passive reconnaissance on the target involves gathering information that is already available on the internet and doing so without directly interacting with the target system.
Methods of passive reconnaissance involve using Google syntax, enumerating website subdomains, links, and services like the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/). 

- As this is a new application that is being hosted through a hosting company, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), no results were found through passive reconnaissance; Google, WayBack Machine, Bing, Duck Duck Go, or binsearch.info.

- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) produced no results related to the application.



#### Active Reconnaissance
Active reconnaissance on the target involved directly probing the target system and retrieving an output.
Methods of active reconnaissance involve fingerprinting the web application, using the Shodan network scanner, performing a DNS forward and reverse lookup, and examining the source code; to name a few.


- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) produced a few open ports but they were all related specifically to Netlify and is not included in the scope.
- Upon inspecting the request header, the following information was retrieved:
 - The server for the main app is called "Netlify". As this is the hosting company, this makes since.
 - The server from the api is called "Cowboy".
 - (HTTP Strict Transport Security) HSTS is enforced as the site will not load from http. 
- When using ZAP to perform an "active scan" on the site nothing new was produced. ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fa7cizvi64uoopqwat2i.png)
- robots.txt file does not exist and the site doesn't have any other pages so nothing else populates.
- Upon signup and login attempt it can be seen that there is traffic to the api at "https://the-trapper-keeper.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users" ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0czyggslaq11o1bspo4h.png)
- An error message of "Please log in" is displayed if you try to access the api directly.
