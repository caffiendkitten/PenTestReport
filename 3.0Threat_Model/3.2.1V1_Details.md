- Issues Found: <br /> 
1. X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.
2. The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type.
3. The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.
4. No Content Security Policy (CSP); an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. 
5. No Feature Policy Header; an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. 
6. A dangerous JS function seems to be in use that would leave the site vulnerable.
7. The content was retrieved from a shared cache. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. 
8. Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server. 
9. A timestamp was disclosed by the application/web server - Unix
10. The response appears to contain suspicious comments which may help an attacker.
