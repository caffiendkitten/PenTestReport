# 2.0 Attack Narrative

## 2.3 Threat Model

A threat model is a visual representation of the flow of data in an application that is used to identify gaps in security and vulnerable points, also as well help to categorize and prioritize the threats found during a penetration test. Therefore, when reporting mitigation recommendations it helps by bridging the gap between developers and security experts and allows everyone to have knowledge and awareness, though documentation, of all the identified and rated threats for a project.

__~For this penetration test the threat model will be used as a guide and will be modified with as the findings of the penetration test are filled in.~__

- The STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service) approach will be used through the open source tool from OWASP, [Threat Dragon](https://threatdragon.org/).

- The ZAP Scanning Report will also be used to help identify any associated CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) and WASCs (Web Application Security Consortium).
- A CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) will be used with the visual model to provide a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score (ranging from 0-10, with 10 being the most severe) depicting its severity. ![logo](https://miro.medium.com/max/394/1*GMTnl3IFaXVINgAhxTMfuA.png "Logo Title")
