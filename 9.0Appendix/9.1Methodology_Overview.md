# 9.0 Appendixes

## 9.1 Appendix A: Methodology Overview

The testing process begins with detailed scanning and research into the architecture and environment, with the performance
of automated testing for known vulnerabilities. Manual exploitation of vulnerabilities follows, for the purpose of
detecting security weaknesses in the application.

#### Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is carried out through the process of reviewing the available documentation, automated scanners (such as nmap and BurpSuite), as well as application fingerprinting and discovery to determine how the application functions. The primary goal in this process is to discover crucial data about SEPA and providing the foundation for a tailored penetration test. 

#### Automated Application Profiling
A vulnerability scanner is used to provide a foundation for the full manual assessment. The user group and role matrix is considered, along with other critical aspects of the security model. Finally, key properties of the application's security controls are documented and each finding is manually verified to ensure accuracy and remove false positives.
he manual tests included review of the following:
• Direct interaction with the application (anonymous)
• Direct interaction with the application (privileged access with credentials)
• Review of system configurations
• Third party API interfaces and services



__Further testing components may include:__
• Application Environment Testing – Network vulnerability assessment of server and network platforms identify any issues in the application’s supporting infrastructure.
• Unauthenticated Testing – Conduct tests with application assessment tools without authenticating to simulate an unauthenticated attacker. This includes a manual walkthrough of the application target with the assessment tool to configure the test run.
• Authenticated Testing – Conduct tests with user accounts included in the scope of the assessment. These include manual walkthroughs of the application target with the assessment tool to configure the test runs.

Below is a listing of some of the high-level categories that may be included in application testing. This is not a comprehensive list of all the areas to be tested in the assessment.
• Abuse of Functionality
• Application Automation
• Audit and Logging Controls
• Authentication Deficiencies
• Authorization Deficiencies
• Command Execution
• Data Privacy and Integrity Controls
• Data Validation and Sanitization
• Encryption Implementations and Key Management
• Endpoint and Client Security Controls
• File and I/O Handling
• Injection Based Flaws
• Race Conditions
• Secure Channel Enforcement
• Service Configuration and Security
• Session Management
• UI and Content Security

#### Exploration and Verification
This phase is to use the results of the automated scan, paired with their expert knowledge and experience, to validate and potentially exploit the vulnerabilities identified through a proof of concept. This activity helps demonstrate the impact a particular issue can have on the environment, allows for further system penetration, and aids in identifying false positives. 
The detailed results of both the vulnerability scan and the manual testing are shown in this report.


#### Threat Analysis Reporting
Once the engagement is complete, DC Security works with the application owners to identify critical data and functionality in the application that could be a target for attackers. This data is identified along with notes regarding its use and location within the application environment. The assessment team documents threat scenarios  set an industry standard for clear and concise reports, prioritizing the highest risk vulnerabilities first, based on information from the development team as well as their own experience with application security.
