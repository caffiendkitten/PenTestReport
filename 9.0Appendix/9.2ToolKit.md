## 9.2 Appendix B: ToolKit

The software and tools used for security analysis are constantly evolving and changing. To stay at the forefront of industry trends, Rhino Security Labs regularly updates and integrates new tools into its Web Application assessment methodology. 
Below is the toolset our consultants use during a Web Application assessment.


#### Burp Suite and ZAP Professional
Burp Suite and ZAP are security platforms created specifically for the purposes of intensive web application testing. Its capabilities cover the entire vulnerability assessment process, from mapping and analysis of an application to the exploitation of identified vulnerabilities

#### Hashcat
Hashcat is the considered world's fastest password recovery tool. It harnesses the power of GPUs and CPUs to bruteforce and crack hashes extracted from a large number of different devices, servers or services.

#### Dirb
DIRB is a Web Content Scanner that looks for existing (and/or hidden) web objects. It functions by launching a dictionary-based attack against a web server and analyzing the response. DIRB searches for specific web objects that other generic CGI scanners often miss, but does not perform vulnerability scans.
