SIEM alerts of vulnerability scans

During the assessment, the DC security team alerted SEPA engineers of detected vulnerability scanning against their systems.  The team was successfully able to identify the DC engineer’s attacker IP address within minutes of scanning and was capable of blacklisting DC from further scanning actions.

The following traits were identified as strengths in SEPA’s environment.
1. Proper implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for login forms.
2. Passwords in database are hashed using a strong algorithm.
3. Strong access controls in place for each user role. -->
