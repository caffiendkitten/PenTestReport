# 1.0 Executive Summary

## 1.5 Security Weaknesses 





<h2>

(To be filled in. Examples below)


<!-- 
DC leveraged multiple attacks against DC login forms using valid credentials harvested through open-source intelligence.  Successful logins included employee e-mail accounts through Outlook Web Access and internal access via Active Directory login on the VPN.  The use of multi-factor authentication would have prevented full access and required DC to utilize additional attack methods to gain internal network access.
Weak Password Policy

1. Poor sanitation of user input lead to multiple vulnerabilities.
2. Application running as root on server and has permissions to files it shouldn't need to access.
3. Lack of brute force protection on login forms
4. Missing Multi-Factor Authentication

DC successfully performed password guessing attacks against DC login forms, providing internal network access.  A predictable password format of Summer2018! (season + year + special character) was attempted and successful.  
Unrestricted Logon Attempts

During the assessment, DC performed multiple brute-force attacks against login forms found on the external network.  For all logins, unlimited attempts were allowed, which permitted an eventual successful login on the Outlook Web Access application.   -->
