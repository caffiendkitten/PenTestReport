(To be filled in. Examples below)
<!-- 


Not all security weaknesses are technical in nature, nor can they all be remediated by security personnel. Companies often have to focus on the root security issues and resolve them at their core. These strategic steps are changes to the operational policy of the organization. 

Based on the results achieved during the test project DC makes the following recommendations (presented by order of priority):
1. Ensure proper development and repository practices by in-house and 3rd party developers.
2. Require authentication for publicly accessible pages and directories that have sensitive information.
3. Remove legacy servers, subdomains, pages, and other web resources no longer in use.
4. Sanitize all user inputs before processing it on the server side of the application.
5. Enhance security defenses with additional detection and response capabilities, such as a SIEM.
